Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google and launched in the year 2011. The programming language syntax is similar to Java & C++ and can be used to build mobile, desktop, server and web applications. There are many reasons why Flutter uses dart and we will focus on the main reasons.

### Compiling and Executing

Dart supports both types of compilation.

1. **JIT** (Just in Time)
   ; JIT compilation is performed during the development of an app and for fast compiler, 
2. **AOT** (Ahead of Time)
   ; AOT compilation is performed when your app is ready for release and deployment.

### Hot Reload
My favorite part about development with Flutter. Flutter uses a JIT compiler that can reload and continue executing code usually in under a second. Hot reload just displays the code changes according to new code changes without restarting the app from the start and its effects only on the changed code or change will only apply to a specific component. I need to make some lifestyle changes. Because I've made all critical decisions about my life during android studio builds.

### Animation
Dart is compiled and executed instantly native code. There is no JS bridge as usual in React Native. With that, Flutter provides developers to make smooth animation and transition at 60fps. Dart provides to Flutter since it starts at a faster speed in object allocation and garbage collection. It also supports third-party integration for making and using animations like Lottie and Flare.

### Layout

Flutter uses Dart as Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML. So you don't need to learn another language for building layouts. We can make a layout in dart using the widgets that add another advantage for flutter developers.
