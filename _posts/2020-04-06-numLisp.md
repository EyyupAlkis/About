After one of my professors talked about LISP in his class and how little work it takes to build a LISP interpreter, I wanted to try it out myself.
So I created [numLisp](https://github.com/skn0tt/numLisp) - a *very* na√Øve LISP interpreter that only understands lists and numbers.
I've learned a lot doing that, so I created some an interactive slides about it.
Enjoy! :)
