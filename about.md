Lifetime learner and curious. Nowadays I am having lovely times with learning Flutter & Dart for cross-platform development and Jetpack Compose for android development. Busy to keep updated myself. Want to work on flutter and interesting android projects. If you want me to work together, don't hesitate to reach out!.
